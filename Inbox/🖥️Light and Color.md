# 🖥️Light and Color
+ The **frequence**, $\omega$, of light determines its **"color"**
	- **Wavelength**, $\lambda$, is related: $\lambda = \frac{1}{\omega}$
	- **Energy** also related
+ Describe incoming light by a **spectrum**
	- Intensity of light at each frequency
	- A graph of intensity vs. frequency
+ We care about a certain span of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, which is between the infra-red (700 nm) and the ultra-violet (400 nm)

## Other Colors
Most colros seen are a mix light of several wavelengths

### White
![[white.png]]<br>
+ **Color** and **Intensity** are technically two different things
+ However, in common usage we use color to refer both
	- $white = grey = black$ in terms of color
+ You will have to use **context（上下文）** to extract the meaning

### Helium（氦） Neon（氖） Laser
![[He-Ne-Laser.png]]<br>
+ **Lasers** emit light at a single wavelength, hence they appeat colored in a very **"pure"** way

### Normal Daylight
![[Normal_Daylight.png]]<br>
+ Note that hump（駝峰） at **short wavelengths** -> the sky is blue
+ Other bumps（顛簸） came from **solar emission spectra** and **atmospheric adsorption（吸附、吸收）**

### Tungsten Light Bulb
![[Tungsten_Light_Bulb.png]]<br>
+ Most light sources are **not anywhere** near white（不是白色的）
+ It is a major research effort to develop light sources with **particular properties**

## Emission vs. Adsorption
+ **Emission（放射）** is what light soreces do
+ **Adsorption** is what paints, inks, dyes, etc. do
+ Emission produces light, adsorption removes light
+ We still talked about adsorption spectra, but noe is it **the proportion of light** that is **removed** at each frequency
+ Note that adsorption depends on such things as the surface finish（光潔度） (glossy（光面）, matte（啞光）) and the substrate（基質） (e.g. paper quality)

### Example: Absorption Spectra: Red Paint
![[absorption_spectra_red_paint.png]]<br>
**Red paint** **adsorbs** **green** and **blue** wavelengths, and **reflects red** wavelengths, resulting in you seeing a red appearence.
