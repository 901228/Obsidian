# 🖥️Light and Color
+ The **frequence**, $\omega$, of light determines its **"color"**
	- **Wavelength**, $\lambda$, is related
	- **Energy** also related
+ Describe incoming light by a **spectrum**
	- Intensity of light at each frequency
	- A graph of intensity vs. frequency
+ We care about a certain span of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, which is between the infra-red (700 nm) and the ultra-violet (400 nm)

## Other Colors
Most colros seen are a mix light of several wavelengths

### White
+ **Color** and **Intensity** are technically two different things
+ However, in common usage we use color to refer both
	- $white = grey = black$ in terms of color
+ You will have to use **context（上下文）** to extract the meaning
