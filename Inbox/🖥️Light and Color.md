# 🖥️Light and Color
+ The **frequence**, $\omega$, of light determines its **"color"**
	- **Wavelength**, $\lambda$, is related
	- **Energy** also related
+ Describe incoming light by a **spectrum**
	- Intensity of light at each frequency
	- A graph of intensity vs. frequency
+ We care about a certain span of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, which is between the infra-red (700 nm) and the ultra-violet (400 nm)

## Other Colors
Most colros seen are a mix light of several wavelengths

### White
![[white.png]]<br>
+ **Color** and **Intensity** are technically two different things
+ However, in common usage we use color to refer both
	- $white = grey = black$ in terms of color
+ You will have to use **context（上下文）** to extract the meaning

### Helium（氦） Neon（氖） Laser
![[He-Ne-Laser.png]]<br>
+ **Lasers** emit light at a single wavelength, hence they appeat colored in a very **"pure"** way

### Normal Daylight

+ Note that hump（駝峰） at **short wavelengths** -> the sky is blue
+ Other bumps（顛簸） came from **solar emission spectra** and **atmospheric absorption（吸收）**

### Tungsten Light Bulb
![[Tungsten_Light_Bulb.png]]<br>
+ Most light sources are **not anywhere** near white（不是白色的）
+ It is a major research effort to develop light sources with **particular properties**


## Absorption Spectra: Red Paint

**Red paint** **absorbs** **green** and **blue** wavelengths, and **reflects red** wavelengths, resulting in you seeing a red appearence.
