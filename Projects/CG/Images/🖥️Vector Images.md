# 🖥️Vector Images

## Vector Images
+ Store images as collections of **geometric primitives** (e.g. lines, polygons, circles, curves)
+ It's **possible to go from a vector image to a raster image**
	+ It's **very hard to go the other way**
+ The most common use of vector formats are **in fonts** -- images of characters (Postscript, TrueType)

## Scalable Vector Graphics
+ Use curves to describe the color boundry: interior has the same color operations.
+ Use distance to a point/line segment to define gradient color (linear color variation)
+ Transparent composition to make color varieties
